### Software Development

**Health Track[NoSQL database project]**
<p>This project is called the health track. This platform is designed to help doctors to keep track of the patients who are tested positive of COVID19.  Patients can use this platform to report their daily health status (including today's symptoms, today's temperature, whether they have gone somewhere. if they have, whether they wear a facial mask). The doctor can be able to manage all his patients' health status(data, bar char, line graph etc) so that they can view the visual data more clearly and they can also care for the patients more efficiently. Only after 14 days without fever and no symptoms can they make an appointment with doctor. Doctor can also manage all the appointments made by patients, they can also update the test result via this platform.  </p>

***Highlights of this project***
<ol>
  <li>Use <strong>Mongodb</strong> to store all the data</li>
  <li>Use <strong>Express</strong> to make API service</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Applying both <strong>access token and basic authentication</strong> method to request access to the API</li>
    <li>Implementing <strong>Authentication+Access Token+ Refresh Token</strong> using <strong>JWT</strong></li>
    <li>Applying <strong>image hash</strong> mechanism to save the users' profile pictures to stregthen the security </li>
    <li>Using <strong>hash/sal</strong> to store users password.</li>
    <li>Implementing <strong>rate limit</strong> to restrict the use of some API(ex, Users can only change password once a day)
    <li>Applying <strong>Pagination</strong> to the some of the API(which return large amount of data)</li>
    <li>Implementing Chatting System using <strong>socket io</strong></li>
     
  </ol>
  <li>Use <strong>Reactjs</strong> to make frontend</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Applying invitation code mechanism to cluster patients</li>
    <li>Using <strong>regex</strong> to check the whether the password is strong enough</li>
    <li>Displaying Data visualization(Visualization of the patients' data)+ Export the Data into CSV</li>
    <li>Using <strong>Redux</strong> to manage the software global state</li>
    <li>Performing quality assurance after implementation and taking notes of the API documentation</li>
    
  </ol>
</ol>

**Movie online platform[SQL database project]**
<p>Database Design Project (SQL) developed a management system for cinema to store and manipulate movies and search movies or tickets by customers.  Customers can sign up and then sign into the account to view movies time slots, buy movies tickets, manage the movies tickets, etc, whereas admin can manage all the customers' status, movies status, and check some related statistics about the recent movies, for example, which movie is the most popular one recently, etc. </p>
